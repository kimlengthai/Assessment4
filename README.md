# Pac-Student Recreation Game
A classic game in the world of video games, Pac-Student
# About the game
Pac-Man is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1980 by Namco. You as a player control the Pac-Student, through a maze. The objective is to eat all the dots (pellets) in a maze while avoiding four colourful ghosts.
# Pac-Student Recreation Game
As the game progresses, the speed of the ghosts increases, and the maze layout becomes more complex. Additional challenges, such as bonus rounds and higher difficulty levels, are introduced as players advance through levels. Pac-Student has three lives, represented by icons at the bottom of the screen. Losing a life occurs when Pac-Student collides with a ghost.
This is a remake of the class Pac-Man in C#. Students have to rename this as a Pac-Student. This project was part of an assignment I submitted for 31263 Introduction to Computer Game Development at UTS.
